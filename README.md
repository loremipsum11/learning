## [Link to my awesome quote](#lets-quote-something-now)

## so in links
- all the spaces are replaced by - 
- all the puntuations are removed
- everything is lower case

These normal lines will be rendered as paragraphs

**This is BOLD text**

*This is italic text*

~~This is strikethrough text~~

**This is a mixture of *ITALIC* ~~strikethrough~~ and all bold text**

***Let's Learn Lists***
1. Pont number one
    1. Nested to point 1
3. **oops!! point number three in wrong place**
~~these lines are extra in between give space after points~~
2. Point Number two

2. Point Number two

lets seperate both of these lists

**Smarter List**
1. Instead
1. use 1 for all
1. renders in order


# Creating Code blocks

example : `lmao you suck`

this is a multi line code block

```
    stupid java codes
    
    class Profanity{
        public static void main(String [] args){
            System.out.print("lmao you still suck");
        }
    }  
}

```

```java
    stupid java codes
    
    class Profanity{
        public static void main(String [] args){
            System.out.print("lmao now you suck in color");
        }
    }  
}

```

- I'm so cool

- the spacing is actually weird in lists

- if I give space it fucks up
